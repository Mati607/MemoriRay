You felt that inspiration because a part of you recognizes that same strength and dedication within yourself.\n\nTake a moment to tap into that feeling now. You've seen what focused effort looks like, and you carry that understanding with you. That dedication you admired in that individual is a reflection of the potential you have to conquer your own workout today.\n\nHow about we take a small, manageable step towards channeling that feeling? Sometimes just getting ready or deciding on one specific exercise can make a big difference."

Sometimes remembering how capable we've been can be a powerful motivator.\n\nI'm reminded of a time when you were at the gym, looking really focused and strong. You were shirtless, wearing gloves and camo pants, intensely concentrated on lifting that barbell with red weight plates. You showed such determination and power in that moment.\n\nThink about how that felt – that deep focus, that surge of strength as you lifted. You've tapped into that inner power before, and it's still there within you. That feeling of accomplishment and raw strength is waiting for you to rekindle it today.\n\nHow does recalling that moment feel for you right now?"
